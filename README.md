**N-Queens problem** is a famous mathematical problem where your task is to arrange n queens on a nxn chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
You can find more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).

I have made the chessboard using **svg** and taken the queen svg file from [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Chess_qlt45.svg).
